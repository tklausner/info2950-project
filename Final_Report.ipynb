There are multiple sections in the notebook and they will be organized in the following format: **Introduction, Data Description, Preregistration Statement, Data Analysis, Evaluation of Signifigance, Interpretation and Conclusion, Limitations, Souce Code, and Acknowledgements.** In addition to this file we also have two appendicies.

    "\n",
    "In this project we wanted to work with multiple data sets, so we decided explore food expenditure and internet data. The first step was to clean both data files. After both files were clean and ready to work with we merged them based on country. Another goal was discovering how factors impact internet quality by country. To do this we built a multiple regression model which told us that some of the most important factors on internet quality are "

    "## Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using data about internet usage internationally and a separate dataset containing GDP and food expenditure internationally. We combined the two datasets into one where rows are countries and columns of interest from the internet dataset are gender gap in internet access, urban electricity access, rural electricity access, smartphone cost, level of web accessibility, trust in online privacy, total electricity access, internet users. The columns of interest from the other dataset are GDP, and food expenditure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why was this dataset created?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The internet data set was created to measure four categories of “The Inclusive Internet Index,” which tracks internet services in countries across the world. The four categories are affordability, availability, relevance and readiness. The index is meant for advocacy organizations, local governments and journalists. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was created by Our World in Data, which wanted to look at the relationship between GDP per person and food expenditure per person. The data was originally sourced from the World Bank, whose goal is to help countries solve issues. They record many general statistics for nearly every country.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Who funded the creation of the dataset?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The internet service dataset was funded by Facebook. The data seems to be funded to support Facebook's internet.org whose mission is to bring internet access to those who do not have it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The World Bank funded the creation of the second dataset, and they receive funding from returns on their investments, country membership fees, and donations made by members\n",
    "\n",
    "**What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of finding how connected people are is more than just taking a survey of <5,000 people. This information may not be representative of the true experience people have in their country. Lastly there is the issue of having a device that connects to the internet. People may be able to afford internet access, but cannot afford the initial price of buying a device. Although the survey apparently covers 91% of the population, can we be sure of that number? \n",
    "\n",
    "For the GDP and food expenditure per person, they are calculated by dividing total GDP and food expenditure by population. The World Bank sources this data from other organizations that are more specific to countries or groups of countries, such as the U.S. Census Bureau. What data was recorded and what wasn’t is determined by how well these organizations sampled and surveyed the population, and also how well the population responded to these surveys.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data appears to be compiled into a single file with many different columns that measure a variety of metrics about internet service. If the data was from surveys was then compiled into countries. The data also combines some of information into categories like regions (such as North America and others). \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to the internet data, the food/GDP data was taken from survey within each country. This data was taken from these countries by the World Bank and they compiled all of it into one table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If people are involved, were they aware of the data collection and if so, what purpose did they expect the data to be used for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes the data was collected through a survey which asked 4,953 participants from 99 countries across Asia-Pacific, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. Considering they took a survey they likely knew the data was being collected. The source is unclear about what the participants thought the data was for. \n",
    "\n",
    "People were certainly aware of this data collection, and the purpose that the participants expected the data to be used for was not specified online. We would guess that they expect it to be used for general government purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where can your raw source data be found, if applicable? Provide a link to the raw data.** \n",

    "#### Our Two Analyses\n",
    "1) We will analyze the relationship between food expenditure and each of the columns in the internet dataset that we kept after cleaning. We hypothesize that some of these columns may have a relationship with food expenditure, and we would like to find out which ones do. We will conclude by using p-values and confidence intervals to examine whether these relationships are statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) We would like to build a model for internet accessibility given all of the other columns in the dataset that we kept after cleaning. We will build a multiple regression model where we will find out which predictors are statistically significant. From the final model, we will not only know what factors impact internet accessibility within countries, but we will also be able to predict the internet accessibility of a country that isn’t listed in the dataset using this model."
