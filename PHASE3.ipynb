We will build a multiple regression model where we will find out which predictors are statistically significant. From the final model, we will not only know what factors impact internet accessibility within countries, but we will also be able to predict the internet accessibility of a country that isnâ€™t listed in the dataset using this model."

We hypothesize that some of these columns may have a relationship with food expenditure, and we would like to find out which ones do. We will conclude by using p-values and confidence intervals to examine whether these relationships are statistically significant."
